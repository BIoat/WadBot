# Installation

Read The [setup guide](https://setup.wadbot.lol/) first.

### Download

- open CMD as admin (important)
- open [The Installscript](install.bat) in a new tab and paste it into CMD (don't change anything)
- once finished, right click the exe and rename it to YourWadBotLicense_7.0.0.exe
- (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_7.0.0.exe)

### Help
###### x problem

- run CMD as admin (it says open CMD as admin for a reason)
- rename the exe so it's yourlicense.exe, not yourlicense.exe, but yourlicense.exe (your actual license for gods sake)
